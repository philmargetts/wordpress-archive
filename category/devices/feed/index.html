				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I dropped my phone just before Christmas :(. I was visiting family in Sydney and decided it was a nice night for a run. As I wove through the streets of Balmain I felt my large phone was secure in my pocket. I was wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-191"></span></p>
<p>Less than 1km from where I was staying and ‚Ä¶ crack! Out it slipped and bit the dust. Being a relatively affordable Xaomi device ‚Äì and with a failing power button ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt really think it was worth the cost of repair.</p>
<p>So I figured it was time for a new phone. But I wanted to try something different. I wanted a device I could use on my terms. Something that wouldn‚Äôt get in the way of life, but still afforded the convenient communication, navigation and organisation functions that we now take for granted. But no email or social media! (However, my <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshosix-months-with-an-ipad-apple-pencil/">iPad</a> is rarely that far away‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>For me, this meant something in a smaller form factor. Something I could comfortably take on runs and hikes. When the ‚Äúbest compact phones‚Äù lists had pretty large and expensive devices (like <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/742-best-small-phones.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/mobile-phone/best-small-smartphone-3675378/">here</a>), I knew I had to look somewhere else.</p>
<p>I turned to the cheap stuff.</p>
<p>Android has a less-than-positive reputation for the longevity of budget devices, so I started reading up on the recently-announced <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/go-edition/">Android Go edition</a>. Summary: stripped down Android optimised for low-end devices. Great, now to find a decent Android Go available in Australia. There were a few cheaper options around with larger screens, but I found a few smaller options. There was the Nokia 1 with 4.5‚Äù display for <a href="https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/nokia-1-ta-1047-8gb-blue-nokia/">~$120 from Kogan</a>, but we could go smaller and cheaper. $77 for a 4‚Äù screen with 4G/LTE for hotspot? Sounds good. The (unlocked) <a href="https://www.allphones.com.au/telstra-essential-smart-4-4g-lte-android-go-black">ZTE Telstra Essential Smart A125</a> will do me, I thought. (I forget exactly how I came across this model, but a great find it was!)</p>
<p>Its been a few weeks with my bargain phone and it has been great. Small phones are much more pleasant to take actual phone calls with! In reality, a phone like this can do everything a $1000+ flagship can, whether you want it to or not. Video calls, check. Messaging, check. Emails, web browsing, camera, Google Maps‚Ä¶ the main practical difference being the speed and quality with which these are accomplished.</p>
<p>This has prompted some reflection. I think what we need to ask of ourselves is not ‚Äúwhat device should I buy‚Äù, but rather ‚Äúwhy do I want it?‚Äù. It seems in the constant development of technology, smartphone manufacturers haven‚Äôt stopped to ask whether we should be cramming all of this functionality into our pockets.</p>
<p>Yes these nicer devices offer a &#8220;pleasurable experience&#8221;, making us want to use them more and more, but we have to remember that technology is a tool. It is designed to serve us and not other way around. This cheap phone does everything I need, and the not-quite-instant load times force me to question the necessity of whatever I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p>So should you buy the shiny, new iPhone this September? Maybe‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not saying we shouldn‚Äôt indulge in the latest technologies, or that they can‚Äôt be beneficial, but perhaps sometimes we need to take a moment to pause and ask the all important question of <em>why</em>&#8230;</p>

<p>Beyond prompting privileged westerners to question their technology habits, I think the potential for connectedness in developing nations is even more exciting. Watch this space over the next few years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In July 2018 I bought an iPad (see post: <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowhy-ibought-an-ipad/">Why iBought an iPad</a>). Here are some of my thoughts six months on.</p>
<p><span id="more-193"></span></p>
<p>In my earlier post I listed my goal to&nbsp;achieve a high-quality&nbsp;<em>digital inking</em>&nbsp;experience for&nbsp;<em>minimal cost</em> (relative, of course). The 2018 iPad (6th gen) and Apple Pencil has definitely ticked this box for me!</p>
<p>I use digital inking in three key functions: <strong>meetings</strong>, <strong>planning/conceptualisation</strong> and <strong>study</strong>.</p>
<p>From one-on-one scrawl to board meetings with several hundred pages of agenda items and attachments, the iPad has served me well. Laptops are great but I feel that a vertical screen can create a barrier between people, whereas a tablet laying flat is far less intrusive.</p>
<p>Digital ink (+OneNote!) is a great way to &#8220;think on paper&#8221; for planning and brainstorming. A great example of this is noting key takeaways from an annual learning technology review, with the ability to use different colours while easily linking key ideas and manipulating text.</p>
<p>For study, simply put: the ability to take any document or slide deck and dump a printout into a OneNote page is awesome. Its like being able to instantaneously print out a file and glue it to an infinite roll of butcher&#8217;s paper <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Apart from OneNote &#8211; whose short sync times are great but battery consumption could be improved &#8211; the iPad is a great reading, web browsing, video watching and communication device. iOS&#8217; fluid gesture controls and ample processing power make navigation a pleasure, and the touch keyboard experience is great. Put this in a highly portable form factor and the its a device I really enjoy using. iOS has definitely come a long way but it won&#8217;t be replacing a desktop OS any time soon,</p>
<p>Does the 2018 iPad have all the flashy features and the ultimate, premium &#8220;Apple feel&#8221; compared with the latest iPad Pros? No, but it also doesn&#8217;t share the hefty price tag, making it all the more suited to education.</p>
<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m also likely to be relying on the iPad more with my switch to a $77 smartphone running Android Go! Post to come&#8230; (edit:&nbsp;<a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshonew-year-new-phone/">here it is</a>)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never been a big user of Apple products. Like many people, I find the higher prices a barrier for entry to the revered &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; (especially when I can buy a Lenovo ThinkPad Edges series for a fraction of the cost!) There&#8217;s no doubt they create a great user experience, through the marriage of quality hardware with tailored software, but I&#8217;ve never felt the need to enter into that world &#8211; until now.</p>
<p><strong>My goal: achieve a high-quality <span style="text-decoration: underline;">digital inking</span> experience for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">minimal cost</span>.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-149"></span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>why</strong> of this purchase: I&#8217;ve found that integrating inking-capable devices into my workflows engages me far more in content or planning, and encourages greater cognition of the core ideas going on; all while allowing the flexibility of using digital medium. This personal experience validates &#8211; at least in my own mind &#8211; much of the research and around the process of writing being superior to typing alone.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Just a discussion of my device preferences and how a device for inking fits into that. Different things work for different people, and I enjoy seeing different perspectives. Enjoy with a grain of salt <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>
<p>I already have my <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-edge/Thinkpad-E570/p/22TP2TEE570">ThinkPad E570</a> from last year, which provides a mobile computing experience I enjoy with the larger 15.6&#8243; display and upper-medium tier specs.&nbsp;I find anything less than 14-15&#8243; is two small for me to see enough at once, especially when talking about &#8220;traditional&#8221; desktop operating systems like Windows 10. It&#8217;s also easily docked to peripherals when at the desk.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.lenovo.com/medias/Hero-Image.png?context=bWFzdGVyfHJvb3R8NzY1OTl8aW1hZ2UvcG5nfGg0YS9oYWQvOTMyNjg2NDk1NzQ3MC5wbmd8MTI3NDVhY2Y0NGY5YTE2M2Y4MTZhMDdmMDI3OTc0NTQwZTFjOWU1YzFiMTRjMGJjZWZmYzg5MGNmNDJiMWMwMg" alt="Image result for thinkpad e570" width="491" height="349"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/medias/Hero-Image.png?context=bWFzdGVyfHJvb3R8NzY1OTl8aW1hZ2UvcG5nfGg0YS9oYWQvOTMyNjg2NDk1NzQ3MC5wbmd8MTI3NDVhY2Y0NGY5YTE2M2Y4MTZhMDdmMDI3OTc0NTQwZTFjOWU1YzFiMTRjMGJjZWZmYzg5MGNmNDJiMWMwMg">Lenovo</a></em></p>
<p>Having tried a few different two-in-one, convertible devices, I found that all have major compromises, especially when compared with other options. For tablet-oriented, Microsoft Surface-esque devices &#8211; the prioritisation of the tablet experience leaves the laptop-configuration experience lacking, with the smaller screen and floppy keyboard making lap use interesting. With the alternate 360-degree, convertible laptops &#8211; the device becomes too heavy and unwieldly to comfortably use as a tablet, and as a laptop, the screen is often on the smaller side, especially for those accustomed to using a larger display.</p>
<p>That leaves standalone tablet devices. Fortunately, Apple came to the rescue releasing the 6th generation of iPad in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkMPXssKX4I">March 2018</a>&nbsp;adding Apple Pencil support with a focus on&nbsp;<strong>education</strong>! Coming in at a very-accessible $439 (AUD, education price) this was the device for me; the only downside being the Apple Pencil was another $129.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="" src="https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/O3falTWGHMIlVUab6dvbA45eb5E=/fit-in/1440x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F744437%2F961ead99-47ee-4be2-a250-2a55b68782f4.jpg" width="494" height="329"></p>

<p>Having operated primarily in a Microsoft environment for the last few years, I&#8217;m keen to dip my toes into the world of Apple. Although I&#8217;ll be making use of my trusty OneNote notebooks, I&#8217;m looking forward to see what Apple&#8217;s latest offering can do for education.</p>
<p>The plan is to have a great, dedicated (and highly-portable) tablet experience while still having the &#8220;proper computer&#8221; functionality with the dedicated laptop. All at a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">price comparable (or less!)</span> than a single convertible device. It helps that I rarely leave home without my trusty Targus backpack&#8230;</p>
<p><em>The iPad is ordered and shipped! I&#8217;m planning on writing a follow-up piece commenting on my experience in 6 months. Be sure to follow on Twitter so you don&#8217;t miss out.</em></p>
